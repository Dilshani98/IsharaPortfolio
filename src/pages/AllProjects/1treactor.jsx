              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
               Led the full mechanical design and commissioning of a 1-ton capacity reactor plant, including Limpert coil, monomer vessel, catalyst vessel, and integrated heat exchanger. Performed shaft and agitator design with detailed calculations, FEA simulations for structural integrity, and motor power sizing for optimal mixing. The upgraded system reduced batch processing time by 30 minutes compared to the previous plant while enhancing energy efficiency, process stability, and product consistency. Delivered a cost-effective, high-performance solution meeting industrial safety and operational standards.
